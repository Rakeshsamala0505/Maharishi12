        <p className="text-content">
          Since early settlers to thriving civilizations, humans have depended
          on millets and ancient crops for food and nutrition.
        </p>
        <h1 className="title fs-3 fs-md-2">Why Millets?</h1>
        <p className="text-content">
          Millets are the most versatile crops, grown in diverse agro-climatic
          conditions. These crops are crucial to the world food economy and
          contribute to food security in many food-insecure regions.
